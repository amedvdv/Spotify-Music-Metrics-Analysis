# Spotify-Music-Metrics-Analysis
A data-driven exploration of how song popularity, album structure, and collaborations impact listener engagement and streaming trends on Spotify.

This project explores how song popularity, album structure, and collaborations impact listener engagement on Spotify. Using a dataset sourced from Hugging Faceâ€™s Spotify Tracks Dataset, we analyze the relationships between popular songs, musical attributes, and total streams across albums.

Key Objectives:
 - Investigate whether albums with highly popular songs experience a spillover effect on other tracks.
 - Compare musical attributes (danceability, energy, tempo) between collaborative and solo songs.
 - Examine if albums featuring multiple artists lead to higher listener engagement and total streams.
  
Methods & Tools:
 - Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
 - Visualizations: Histograms, Box Plots, Scatter Plots, Bar Charts
 - Feature Engineering: Creating new variables such as collaboration, relative_popularity, and popularity_change.
 - 
Impact & Use Cases:
 - Artists & Record Labels can use insights to strategize music releases and maximize engagement.
 - Streaming Platforms (e.g., Spotify) can refine recommendation algorithms based on listener preferences.
 - Data Science Enthusiasts can explore dataset preprocessing, feature extraction, and statistical modeling.
 - 
This project provides a data-driven perspective on music trends and listener behaviors, making it valuable for both the music industry and machine learning applications.
